# Expo Managed Workflow App Intermittent Crashes During Development

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered in an Expo managed workflow application. The application intermittently crashes during development without any clear error messages in the console.  The problem's inconsistent nature makes debugging difficult. The issue is not tied to specific code changes or app actions.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the Expo development server: `expo start`
4. Observe the app's intermittent crashing behavior.  No explicit errors are reported in the Expo developer tools or the console.

## Solution

The solution to this problem involves a thorough review of async operations, particularly the handling of promises and potential race conditions.  The original code might have an unhandled promise rejection or a race condition triggering the crashes.  The `bugSolution.js` file offers a potential solution by adding thorough error handling and ensuring all async operations are correctly managed.  The updated code is more robust, reducing the likelihood of intermittent crashes.
