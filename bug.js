While developing an Expo managed workflow application, I encountered an unusual issue where the application would crash intermittently during development mode. The crash occurred without any clear error messages in the console, making debugging extremely challenging. This behavior was inconsistent and didn't seem to be related to any particular code change or action within the application. The Expo development server would show no explicit errors; however, the application itself would simply cease functioning, requiring a restart of the development server and the application.
